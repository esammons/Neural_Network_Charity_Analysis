# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview 
* In this analysis we are looking at, and working with deep learning models to analyze donations that are recieved. We are trying to see what amount of these donations are succesfull and actually making a difference in their respected fields. To achieve this goal we are utilizing a deep learning model.
## Results 
* Targets for the model: "is_successful"
* Features for the model: "Application_type","Affiliation","Classification","Use_Case","organization","Status","Income_Amt","special_Considerations"
* Removed Data: "EIN","Name"
* two hidden layers with 80 and 30 nuerons were used for the network. The functions used for the layers were Relu, and Sigmoid. 
* Unfortunatley this network was not able to achieve the target model performance. 
* to increase performance we overfit the model and removed variables from features.
## Summary 
* After running multiple test and changing several variables and factors to still not reach the target percentage would indicate that this method is perhaps not the most efficient solutuion to this problem.
